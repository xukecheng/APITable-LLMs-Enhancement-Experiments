      "To plot a chart of stock price change YTD for NVDA and TESLA and save it as a PNG file, you can use the `yfinance` library to retrieve the historical stock data and the `matplotlib` library to plot the chart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a step-by-step guide:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Install the required libraries by running the following command:\n",
      "```sh\n",
      "pip install yfinance matplotlib\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Import the necessary libraries in Python:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import yfinance as yf\n",
      "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Use `yfinance` to retrieve the historical stock data for NVDA and TESLA:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "nvda = yf.download(\"NVDA\", start=\"2021-01-01\", end=\"2021-12-31\")\n",
      "tesla = yf.download(\"TSLA\", start=\"2021-01-01\", end=\"2021-12-31\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Calculate the year-to-date percentage change for both stocks:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "nvda['YTD Change'] = (nvda['Close'] - nvda['Close'].iloc[0]) / nvda['Close'].iloc[0] * 100\n",
      "tesla['YTD Change'] = (tesla['Close'] - tesla['Close'].iloc[0]) / tesla['Close'].iloc[0] * 100\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Plot the YTD change for both stocks on the same chart:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "plt.plot(nvda.index, nvda['YTD Change'], label='NVDA')\n",
      "plt.plot(tesla.index, tesla['YTD Change'], label='TESLA')\n",
      "plt.xlabel('Date')\n",
      "plt.ylabel('YTD Change (%)')\n",
      "plt.title('NVDA and TESLA Stock Price Change YTD')\n",
      "plt.legend()\n",
      "plt.grid(True)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Save the chart as a PNG file:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "plt.savefig('stock_price_change.png')\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Complete code:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import yfinance as yf\n",
      "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
      "\n",
      "nvda = yf.download(\"NVDA\", start=\"2021-01-01\", end=\"2021-12-31\")\n",
      "tesla = yf.download(\"TSLA\", start=\"2021-01-01\", end=\"2021-12-31\")\n",
      "\n",
      "nvda['YTD Change'] = (nvda['Close'] - nvda['Close'].iloc[0]) / nvda['Close'].iloc[0] * 100\n",
      "tesla['YTD Change'] = (tesla['Close'] - tesla['Close'].iloc[0]) / tesla['Close'].iloc[0] * 100\n",
      "\n",
      "plt.plot(nvda.index, nvda['YTD Change'], label='NVDA')\n",
      "plt.plot(tesla.index, tesla['YTD Change'], label='TESLA')\n",
      "plt.xlabel('Date')\n",
      "plt.ylabel('YTD Change (%)')\n",

      "\n",
      "plt.savefig('stock_price_change.png')\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "After executing the code, you can find the generated PNG file named `stock_price_change.png` in the current directory.\n",
